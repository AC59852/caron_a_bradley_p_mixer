# THK Mixer

## Introduction

Thanks for checking out our music mixer! Create the music you want within **minutes**.
<br>
Just drag and drop the icons anywhere within the lines, and hit play! 
<br>
Each icon makes a different sound, and each sound is changed in pitch based on which
<br>
box you choose to drop the icon. So have fun and upload your mix to our site!

### Setup

Just clone the repo, or download the zip, and open the index.html.
<br>
After that, the designers and developers got everything for you!

### Tools Used

**Sublime Text** - For all of the coding within the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
<br> 
**Photoshop** - For the site wireframe, general design and functionality
<br>
**Illustrator** - For creating the icons you drag and drop

### Additional Notes

For sprint 1, we have decided to leave the working Ai and PS files in the repo.
<br>
This makes it easier for either designer to change objects on the fly with the other
<br>
being ablt to take a quick look at the updated file and give the yes or no, without
<br>
having to change all of the code needed for the what could be small change.

### Designers/Developers

**Austin Caron** - Created the boxed design, JavaScript and PS file
<br>
**Patrick Bradley** - Created the icons, site design and music
